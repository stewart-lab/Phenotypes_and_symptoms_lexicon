# **Phenotypes and synonyms lexicon**  

**Introduction:**    
This phenotypes and symptoms lexicon project is for compiling the lexicon from Human Phenotypes Ontology (HPO), Phenome Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). Among the three resources, only HPO includes synonyms for phenotypes. However, several synonyms are still missing in HPO. We used our diseases lexicon to add missing synonyms to phenotypes and symptoms. Our diseases lexicon is compiled from UMLS Metathesaurus and SNOMED CT. Please see the github project https://github.com/stewart-lab/Diseases_lexicon for details.    

**Prerequisites:**  
Downloading files from HPO, PheWAS and OMIM is free. However, downloading and installing UMLS Metathesaurus and SNOMED CT require license (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/knowledge_sources/metathesaurus/).
