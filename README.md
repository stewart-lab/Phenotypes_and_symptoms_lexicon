# **Phenotypes and synonyms lexicon**  

**Introduction:**    
Phenotypes and synonyms lexicon project is meant to compile the lexicon from Human Phenotypes Ontology (HPO), Phenome Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). UMLS Metathesaurus and SNOMED CT. The project also compiles a unique list of diseases and synonyms from both resources. We also used our diseases lexicon to add the missing synonyms. Our diseases lexicon is compiled from UMLS Metathesaurus and SNOMED CT. Please see the github project https://github.com/stewart-lab/Diseases_lexicon for details.    

**Prerequisites:**  
Downloading files from HPO, PheWAS and OMIM is free. However, downloading and installing UMLS Metathesaurus and SNOMED CT require license (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/knowledge_sources/metathesaurus/).
